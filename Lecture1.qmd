-   Fleming was skilled at administering Salvarsan to patients with syphilis, which led to a small but profitable practice
-   During World War I, Fleming worked in a wound-research laboratory and discovered that chemical antiseptics do not sterilize jagged wounds, and pus has its own antibacterial powers
-   After the war, Fleming focused on studying leukocytes and antisepsis, and in 1921 he discovered lysozyme, a substance that causes bacteria to disintegrate, but its effectiveness was limited against disease-causing bacteria

-   Utterly desperate when the doctor recommended amputation to save his daughter’s life, Domagk treated Hildegard with Prontosil.
-   Hildegard recovered, but suffered a permanent reddish discolouration of her skin owing to the drug

-   Dorothy Hodgkin, a crystallography expert at Oxford University, used X-rays to analyse the structure of various natural products 

-   In 1946, she determined the structure of penicillin, earning her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964

-   Knowledge of the penicillin structure allowed scientists to modify penicillin, leading to the development of semisynthetic versions with broadened spectrum of activity, incrased stability, reduced toxicity

-   Noticed that these cultures produced substances (he named mycetin) that were effective against *Salmonella typhi*, the cause of typhoid fever, which had beta-lactamase.

-   *Streptomyces* bacteria were found to naturally produce a wide range of antimicrobials, leading to the discovery of these important compounds

## Why has new antibiotic discovery faltered?

Empirical screening of fermentation broth was remarkably successful during the early phases of antibiotic discovery

![](images/lowfruit.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}

## Rediscovery of the old antibiotics through empiric screens becomes the biggest challenge

![](images/dereplication.png)

## By the 1970’s antibiotic discovery began to shift from empirical to more “rationale” targeted approaches

<br>

-   Attempts to overcome the increasing work of dereplication with fewer possibilities for novel compound discovery

-   Initially based on the recognition that most useful antibiotics discovered to date targeted the cell wall or protein synthesis

-   Leveraged a growing ability to clone genes and manipulate bacterial strains to enhance whole cell screening (or specific purified proteins) for specific bacterial targets

## 1980s-1990s {.smaller}

<br> <br>

As novel antibiotic discovery began to falter, modification of existing antibiotic scaffolds (pharmacophore) to overcome resistance became a dominant strategy for bringing “new” antibiotics to market

## Problems with targeted antibiotic screening <br>in the 1990s and early 2000s {.smaller}

<br> <br>

-   Bias to towards identification of single target inhibitors (high risk of rapid resistance development)

-   Biased towards human (eukaryotic) targets

    -   Off target effects, higher toxicity potential

-   Chemical screening libraries- Mostly lipophilic compounds with limited structural diversity

    -   Most drugs in libraries were highly flexible pharmacophores with few features found in antibacterial groups such as polar functional groups, complex ring systems, and chiral centers

-   Typical outcomes of whole cell screening: identification of detergent-like compounds or surface-active agents that affect integrity of bacterial cell membrane

-   Typical outcome of cell-free screens: discovery of compounds that would inhibit target protein but no activity against whole cells 

-   Screens rarely identified compounds with Gram-negative activity (because of excessive lipophilicity of screening library)

-   Biggest problem was probably the use of compound screening libraries that did not reflect the unique physicochemical property space occupied by known antibacterial agents

## It is difficult to improve on nature {.smaller}

<br> Densely deployed functional groups, allowing for maximal number of interactions with molecular targets, leads to exquisite selectivity for pathogen targets versus the host

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Targeted screening

-   Specific inhibitors = rationale approach to develop still holds promise

-   Massive advances in synthetic biology (combinatorial biosynthesis, pathways engineering)

-   Development of new “antibiotic-like” chemical scaffolds for screening

-   Experience gained from 30 years of failure:

    -   Knowledge of factors influencing bacterial cell penetration, transport, cellular efflux and protein binding is increasing rapidly- new rules similar to Lipinski 5 to help guide drug design

    -   Use of more “druggable” libraries and combinatorial libraries that mimic natural products

    -   Genetic modification of biosynthetic gene clusters in natural sources (i.e. actinomycetes)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Natural product screening

-   Billions of natural selection have optimized structures for protein interactions and antimicrobial activity

-   **Estimated that less than 1% of prokaryotic and 7% of fungal strains have been isolated and cultured**

-   Density and functionality in many natural products enables inhibition of multiple protein targets simultaneously

-   Complex structures make them poor substrates for metabolizing enzymes (superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics compared to small molecules)

-   More efficient and powerful methods for isolation and de-replication have been developed
